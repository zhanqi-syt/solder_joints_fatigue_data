This project is two datasets for solder joints fatigue data, used in this paper:<br>
***Xu Long, Changheng Lu, Yutai Su, Yecheng Dai,
"Machine learning framework for predicting the low cycle fatigue life of lead-free solders." 
Engineering Failure Analysis (2023): XXXXXX.***<br>
Integrated dataset including 1387 data points is established from formula calculation. <br>
Experimental dataset including 236 data points is collected from the literature. <br>
Feel free to utilize the datasets.
